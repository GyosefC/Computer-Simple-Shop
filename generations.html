          <p>
            The computer has been developing since its birth. During this time,
            the computer has reached the Nickler Artificial Intelligence from
            Vacuum Tube. Computer has achieved this growth in the last 70-80
            years.
          </p>
          <p>
            This development period of the computer is called Computer
            Generations as computer hardware and software changed accordingly
            time to time. So far, 5 generations of computers have been
            determined. Today, we will know about all generation of computer.

          <h2>The First Generations of Computers :</h2>
          <p>
            The beginning of the first generation of computers has been
            considered since 1946. Because at this time two great people J.P.
            Eckert and J.W. Mauchly created the first electronic device based on
            a vacuum tube.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Vacuum Tube was invented in 1904 by John Ambrose Fleming. This
            vacuum tube was used in first-generation computers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Punch Cards, Paper Tap, and Magnetic Tap were used as input devices
            and output devices. In the first generation of computers, machine
            language was used as a programming language. And Magnetic Drums were
            used for memory.

          <p>
            The time period of the second generation of computers has been
            considered as 1956-63. In this generation of computers, transistors
            were used in place of vacuum tubes. Transistor was invented in 1947
            by William Shockley.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now primary and secondary memory started being used in computers.
            And they started supporting Assembly and High-Level Programming
            Language. And they started using Multi-Programming Operating
            Systems.

          <h2>The Third Generations of Computers :</h2>
          <p>
            The period of the third generation of computers is considered to be
            1964-71. The computers of this generation were based on
            IC-Integrated Circuit. The IC was invented by an engineer Jack
            Kilby. A single IC contained a lot of Transistors, Resistors, and
            Capacitors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The invention of IC greatly reduced the size of computers. Now they
            could be easily transported from one place to another. And the use
            of Multi-Programming OS and High-Level Programming Languages
            ​​further improved.

          <h2>The Fourth generations of computer</h2>
          <p>
            The beginning of the fourth generation of computers has been
            considered since 1971. And the time till 1980 is considered for the
            fourth generation.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this time, the IC was further developed. This time ICs could
            have around 5000 transistors. And its executive capacity was equal
            to 3, 00, 00 transistors
          </p>
          <p>
            These ICs were called VLSI – Very Large Scale Integrated Circuit.
            This technology reads the foundation of Microcomputer because Micro
            Processors were being used at this time. This time brought the
            computer revolution and the computer reached the common man.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fourth-generation computers run on Microprocessor. And at this time
            the GUI- Graphical User Interface developed. And Windows, Mac OS was
            created. At the same time companies like Microsoft and Apple
            started. And today they are present.

          <h2>The Fifth Generation of Computers :</h2>
          <p>
            Fifth Generations of Computer are the device on which you are
            reading this article. This is a fifth-generation computer. The
            period of the fifth generation has been considered since 1980. In
            this period, ULSI – Ultra Large Scale Integrated Circuit Based
            Microprocessors started being used in computers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to which it has become very fast and small. Because a ULSI based
            Microprocessor can contain one crore electronic components.
          </p>
          <p>
            Computers of the fifth generation are being made to think like us
            humans. For which technologies like Artificial Intelligence,
            Internet of Things, Robotics, etc. are constantly being developed
            and used.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today’s computers are shaped like a hand clock and are also less
            expensive. Which almost every person can buy. Today, computers have
            reached every person in the world in some form.

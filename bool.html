        <h2>
          The computers understand the boolean language because of that we need
          to talk about the boolean algebra , just (0,1) numbers
        </h2>
        <p>
          A precursor of Boolean algebra was Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's algebra
          of concepts. Leibniz's algebra of concepts is deductively equivalent
          to the Boolean algebra of sets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Boole's algebra predated the modern developments in abstract algebra
          and mathematical logic; it is however seen as connected to the origins
          of both fields. In an abstract setting, Boolean algebra was perfected
          in the late 19th century by Jevons, Schröder, Huntington and others,
          until it reached the modern conception of an (abstract) mathematical
          structure. For example, the empirical observation that one can
          manipulate expressions in the algebra of sets, by translating them
          into expressions in Boole's algebra, is explained in modern terms by
          saying that the algebra of sets is a Boolean algebra (note the
          indefinite article). In fact, M. H. Stone proved in 1936 that every
          Boolean algebra is isomorphic to a field of sets.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the 1930s, while studying switching circuits, Claude Shannon
          observed that one could also apply the rules of Boole's algebra in
          this setting,[8] and he introduced switching algebra as a way to
          analyze and design circuits by algebraic means in terms of logic
          gates. Shannon already had at his disposal the abstract mathematical
          apparatus, thus he cast his switching algebra as the two-element
          Boolean algebra. In modern circuit engineering settings, there is
          little need to consider other Boolean algebras, thus "switching
          algebra" and "Boolean algebra" are often used interchangeably.
        </p>

          Efficient implementation of Boolean functions is a fundamental problem
          in the design of combinational logic circuits. Modern electronic
          design automation tools for VLSI circuits often rely on an efficient
          representation of Boolean functions known as (reduced ordered) binary
          decision diagrams (BDD) for logic synthesis and formal verification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Logic sentences that can be expressed in classical propositional
          calculus have an equivalent expression in Boolean algebra. Thus,
          Boolean logic is sometimes used to denote propositional calculus
          performed in this way.Boolean algebra is not sufficient to capture
          logic formulas using quantifiers, like those from first order logic.

          Whereas expressions denote mainly numbers in elementary algebra, in
          Boolean algebra, they denote the truth values false and true. These
          values are represented with the bits (or binary digits), namely 0 and
          1. They do not behave like the integers 0 and 1, for which 1 + 1 = 2,
          but may be identified with the elements of the two-element field
          GF(2), that is, integer arithmetic modulo 2, for which 1 + 1 = 0.
          Addition and multiplication then play the Boolean roles of XOR
          (exclusive-or) and AND (conjunction), respectively, with disjunction x
          ∨ y (inclusive-or) definable as x + y - xy and negation ¬x as 1 − x.
          In GF(2), − may be replaced by +, since they denote the same
          operation; however this way of writing Boolean operations allows
          applying the usual arithmetic operations of integers (this may be
          useful when using a programming language in which GF(2) is not
          implemented).
